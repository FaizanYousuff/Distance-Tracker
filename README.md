# Distance tracker

 - This app will be called Distance Tracker, and as the name suggests, we will create an app which will be able to track our users location and track the distance which user travels. 
 - Our application will use Foreground Service and it will track users location even from a background when we kill our app. Bottom line, you will be able to  track how many kilometers have you traveled and how much time it took.
